    "In MongoDB, the `delete_one()`, `delete_many()`, and `drop()` methods are used to remove documents or entire collections from the database. Each of these methods serves a specific purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`delete_one()` Method**:\n",
    "   - The `delete_one()` method is used to delete a single document that matches the specified filter criteria.\n",
    "   - If multiple documents match the filter, only the first document encountered will be deleted.\n",
    "   - This method is useful when you want to remove a specific document from a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax of `delete_one()`**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "collection.delete_one(filter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`delete_many()` Method**:\n",
    "   - The `delete_many()` method is used to delete multiple documents that match the specified filter criteria.\n",
    "   - All documents that meet the filter criteria will be deleted.\n",
    "   - This method is useful when you want to remove multiple documents from a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax of `delete_many()`**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "collection.delete_many(filter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`drop()` Method**:\n",
    "   - The `drop()` method is used to delete an entire collection from the database.\n",
    "   - It removes all documents and indexes associated with the collection.\n",
    "   - This method is useful when you want to completely remove a collection and its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax of `drop()`**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "collection.drop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage**:\n",
    "Suppose we have a collection named \"students\" in the \"mydatabase\" database, and we want to demonstrate the usage of these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to the MongoDB server\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")  # Replace with your MongoDB connection string\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Check if connected\n",
    "    if client:\n",
    "        print(\"Connected to MongoDB\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Access the database and collection\n",
    "        database_name = \"mydatabase\"\n",
    "        database = client[database_name]\n",
    "        collection_name = \"students\"\n",
    "        collection = database[collection_name]\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Delete one document\n",
    "        delete_result = collection.delete_one({\"name\": \"Jane Smith\"})\n",
    "        print(\"Deleted documents count:\", delete_result.deleted_count)\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Delete multiple documents\n",
    "        delete_many_result = collection.delete_many({\"age\": {\"$lt\": 25}})\n",
    "        print(\"Deleted documents count:\", delete_many_result.deleted_count)\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Drop the collection\n",
    "        collection.drop()\n",
    "        print(\"Collection dropped\")\n",
    "\n",
    "except pymongo.errors.ConnectionError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Connection error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We connect to the MongoDB server and access the \"mydatabase\" database and \"students\" collection.\n",
    "- We use the `delete_one()` method to delete a single document with the name \"Jane Smith\" and print the number of deleted documents.\n",
    "- We use the `delete_many()` method to delete all documents with an age less than 25 and print the number of deleted documents.\n",
    "- We use the `drop()` method to completely drop the \"students\" collection from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods provide different levels of control over document and collection removal, allowing you to selectively delete documents or drop entire collections as needed. Remember to replace the connection string with your actual MongoDB connection details."
